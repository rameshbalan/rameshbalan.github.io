Hi! I am Balan. I am an Assistant Professor at the Mahindra University. I did my Ph. D. from the University of Texas at Arlington in [Dr. Jeff Demuth's Lab](https://www.uta.edu/faculty/demuth) and my post doc from the University of Idaho in [Dr. Adam Jones's Lab](https://pipefishguysite.wordpress.com/jones-lab-research/). As an evolutionary/computational biologist I am currently working on two broad topics:  
  - understanding the evolutionary origins and implications of sex chromosomes in syngnathid (pipefish and seahorse) fishes.
  - Predicting and simulating mutations that are more likely to cause antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens using evolutionary hypotheses.
